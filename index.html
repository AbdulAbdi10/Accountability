        <p class="image-caption">Mogadishu Somalia.</p>
        
        <p>Somalia is a nation defined by resilience, dignity, and deeply rooted values. From Mogadishu to Kismayo, Beletweyne to Merca, and Baidoa to Garowe, one invisible yet powerful force continues to hold our society together: trust among individuals or what I call <strong>micro-trust</strong>.</p>
        <p>This trust is not abstract. It is lived, practiced, and deeply embedded in daily life. Consider the <strong>Ayuuto</strong> system—a voluntary rotating savings group in which members contribute monthly and take turns receiving the pooled sum. There are no lawyers, no banks, no written contracts—only mutual trust. And yet, it works, flawlessly. This simple yet profound system reflects the honor and responsibility that Somalis uphold within their communities.</p>
        <p>This grassroots trust—<strong>micro-trust</strong>—is the foundation of Somali society. It fuels our informal economy, sustains families, resolves disputes, and shapes the social fabric of our communities. Even in the absence of strong formal institutions, Somalis rely on personal integrity, communal accountability, and shared values to navigate life.</p>
        <p>But here lies a devastating contradiction. When trust moves from the personal to the institutional, from the neighborhood to the nation, it breaks down. The same individuals raised with these honorable values often abandon them when they ascend to public office. A government official with a modest salary may suddenly enjoy a lavish lifestyle—expensive cars, foreign properties, and control over million-dollar contracts—while essential public services like schools, hospitals, housing, roads, and security remain neglected. The corruption touches every public office and this call is not only to the top leaders but also to the ones that touch everyday citizens’ work.</p>
        <p class="subtitle"><strong>How can a society built on grassroots trust tolerate systemic looting at the national level?</strong></p>
        <p>This disconnect—between strong <strong>micro-trust</strong> and fragile <strong>macro-trust</strong>—is the defining crisis of Somalia today. Unless we address it head-on, progress in any area—security, education, infrastructure, or development—will remain out of reach. Public trust and accountability are not just administrative matters; they are national imperatives.</p>
        <p>Importantly, this erosion of trust did not begin with the collapse of the central government in 1991. It predates the civil war, rooted in both the civilian and military regimes that came after independence. From the start, state resources were often treated as spoils for individuals or clans. Corruption and nepotism became entrenched in the machinery of governance, laying the groundwork for the breakdown of public institutions we see today.</p>
        <p>Across decades of instability, repeated cycles of fragile governments, and foreign interventions, one pattern has persisted: those entrusted with power abuse it, and the public loses faith once more. Today, Somalis trust each other—but not their government, not their leaders, and not the institutions meant to serve them.</p>
        <p class="subtitle"><strong>No nation can prosper under such a burden.</strong></p>
        <p>Rebuilding Somalia begins with reconciling personal integrity and public service. We must build a culture in which holding office is not a path to enrichment, but a sacred duty to serve the people. Public officials must be held to the same ethical standards already expected in Somali households and communities.</p>
        <p>Equally important is the role of the public. Society must stop seeking personal favors from those in power. We must resist the culture of patronage and instead become vigilant stewards of public accountability. Citizens should closely observe the lifestyles and wealth of public officials, demanding transparency and oversight. It is entirely reasonable to have systems in place that track the resources and assets accumulated during one’s time in office. This is not about suspicion—it is about civic responsibility and ensuring that leadership remains rooted in service, not self-enrichment.</p>
        <p>If an <strong>Ayuuto</strong> group can circulate thousands of dollars based solely on trust, why can’t a government ministry administer public funds with the same discipline? If local elders can resolve disputes with fairness and honor, why can’t our courts?</p>
        <p class="subtitle"><strong>This double standard must end.</strong></p>
        <p>The path forward begins with a moral awakening. Restoring public trust requires more than rooting out corruption—it demands a reimagining of governance itself. We must cultivate a civic culture in which our public institutions mirror the trust, honor, and cooperation that already exist at the grassroots level.</p>
        <p>As the Somali proverb wisely states: <em>“Nin lagu seexdow ha seexan”</em>—“He who is relied upon should not sleep.” Leadership is not a privilege to be enjoyed; it is a responsibility to be carried with vigilance. When others depend on you, your accountability multiplies.</p>
        <p class="subtitle"><strong>To the Somali people: corruption is not our destiny.</strong></p>
        <p>It is not part of our religion, and it is certainly not part of our culture. We are a people who honor our word. It is time we demand the same from those who govern us.</p>
        <p>Civil society must rise. The youth must organize. Journalists must speak boldly. The diaspora must go beyond remittances and become active voices for reform. And public servants must be reminded daily that they are stewards—not owners—of Somalia’s future.</p>
        <p class="subtitle"><strong>Let our generation be remembered as the one that ended impunity, restored civic trust, and rebuilt a Somalia governed with the same integrity its people demonstrate every day.</strong></p>
        <p>We will not become a great nation until we trust not only each other, but also our leaders, our laws, and our institutions. And that trust must be earned—through honesty, transparency, and unwavering accountability.</p>
        <p class="subtitle"><strong>Let us begin.</strong></p>
