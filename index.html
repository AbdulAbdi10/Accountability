  <h1>Demanding Accountability in Somalia’s Public Life</h1>

<main>
  <p>Somalia is a land of resilience, dignity, and deeply rooted values. From Mogadishu to Kismayo, Beletwein to Merca, and Baidoa to Garowe, one invisible yet powerful force continues to bind our society together: trust among individuals.</p>

  <p>This interpersonal trust is not abstract—it is active, lived, and vibrant. Take the <em>Ayuuto</em> system, for instance. This is a voluntary rotating savings group where members contribute monthly and take turns receiving the pooled amount. There are no lawyers, no banks, and no written contracts—just mutual trust. And it works, flawlessly. It’s a quiet testament to how Somalis honor their word and fulfill their obligations.</p>

  <p>This kind of grassroots trust—<strong>micro-trust</strong>—is the lifeblood of Somali society. It powers our informal economy, sustains families, resolves disputes, and forms the scaffolding of our communities. Even in the absence of strong state institutions, people rely on personal honor, social accountability, and shared values to navigate life.</p>

  <p>But we face a devastating contradiction.</p>

  <p>When trust shifts from the neighborhood to the nation, from the personal to the institutional, it seems to disintegrate. The very people raised in these honorable communities often abandon those values when they acquire public authority. A government official earning a modest income suddenly lives in luxury, drives imported cars, and manages contracts worth millions. Meanwhile, schools collapse, roads erode, and clinics remain barren.</p>

  <p>How can a society that thrives on grassroots trust tolerate such institutional theft?</p>

  <p>This contradiction—strong <strong>micro-trust</strong> and weak <strong>macro-trust</strong>—is Somalia’s central crisis. And unless we confront it, every other national priority will remain unattainable.</p>

  <p>Crucially, the looting of public resources did not begin with the collapse of the central government in 1991. It is a legacy that predates civil war, extending back to both the civilian and military regimes. From the early days of independence, Somalia’s governments too often viewed state resources as personal or clan spoils. Corruption and nepotism were embedded in the structure of governance, laying the groundwork for today’s dysfunction.</p>

  <p>Today, Somalis trust one another—but not their government, not their leaders, and not the systems meant to serve them.</p>

  <p>To truly rebuild Somalia, we must close the gap between personal honor and public service. We must create a culture where public office is not a shortcut to wealth but a solemn duty to serve. We must demand that public officials be held to the same ethical standards that guide our daily lives.</p>

  <p>If a local <em>Ayuuto</em> group can reliably circulate thousands of dollars based on trust alone, why can’t a ministry manage public funds with the same integrity? If elders can resolve disputes with fairness, why can’t courts?</p>

  <p>The path forward begins with a moral awakening. This is not just about fighting corruption—it’s about redesigning the foundation of governance itself. We must cultivate institutions that reflect the honor, discipline, and cooperation already thriving in Somali society.</p>

  <blockquote>“Nin lagu seexdow ha seexan.”<br>He who is relied upon should not sleep.</blockquote>

  <p>Leadership is not a privilege to relax into—it is a burden of vigilance. When others depend on you, your responsibility multiplies.</p>

  <p>To the Somali people: corruption is not our destiny. It is not our religion, and it is not our culture. We are a people who honor our word. It’s time to demand that our public leaders do the same.</p>

  <p>Civil society must rise. Youth must organize. Journalists must speak boldly. The diaspora must not only send remittances but advocate for reform. Public officials must be reminded that they are stewards—not owners—of the nation’s future.</p>

  <p>Let our generation be the one that ended impunity, revived civic trust, and built a Somalia governed with the same integrity its people show every day.</p>

  <p>We will not become a great nation until we can trust not only each other but also our leaders, our laws, and our institutions. And that trust must be earned—through honesty, transparency, and unwavering accountability.</p>

  <p><strong>Let us begin.</strong></p>

  <p>— Abdul Abdi</p>
